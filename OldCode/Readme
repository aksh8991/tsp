Experiments 

	Vary initial population size
	Vary number of nodes
	Vary CUDA/OpenMP threads
	Vary total numbver of iterations (both global and local)

	Algorithms used : Kernighan Lin Algorithm , K Tournament Selection


Step 1 - Use heuristic for tour generation preferably k Nearest neighbor using OpenMP
